# Thesis JSSP Simulator
Code in which experiments for the thesis named "Finding New Heuristics for the Job Shop Scheduling Problem: A Video Game Approach" was done. Code uses data obtained from a videogame to try and simulate players by detecting the heuristic used by them if they used one.

For running this project an API that is able to read .ipynb files is needed
Thesis_Project.ipynb is the main file were experiments were done
The player_data folder contains the data of players obtained from the video game
JSSP_skeleton.ipynb contains the JSSP simulator
